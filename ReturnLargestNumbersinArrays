Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.

Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.

Comparison Operators

code:

function largestOfFour(arr) {
  var results = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var largestNum = arr[i][0];
    for (var j = 1; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
      if (arr[i][j] > largestNum) {
        largestNum = arr[i][j];
      }
    }

    results[i] = largestNum;
  }

  return results;
}
